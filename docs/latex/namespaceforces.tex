This module contains the subroutine {\ttfamily find\+\_\+force\+\_\+\+LJ} which calculates the forces and potential energy between particles using the Lennard-\/\+Jones potential. The module provides a public interface for the {\ttfamily find\+\_\+force\+\_\+\+LJ} subroutine. The {\ttfamily find\+\_\+force\+\_\+\+LJ} subroutine takes in the positions of particles, box size, cutoff distance, and returns the forces acting on the particles and the total potential energy. The forces are calculated using periodic boundary conditions (PBC). The module also contains a private section for internal use.

Calculates the forces and potential energy between particles using the Lennard-\/\+Jones potential. 

This subroutine calculates the forces and potential energy between particles in a system using the Lennard-\/\+Jones potential. The Lennard-\/\+Jones potential is a pairwise potential that models the interaction between neutral atoms or molecules. It is commonly used to simulate the behavior of noble gases and other non-\/reactive systems.

Parameters\+: r\+: real(8), dimension(\+N, 3), intent(in)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The positions of the particles in the system. N\+: integer, intent(in)
\item The number of particles in the system. L\+: real(8), intent(in)
\item The length of the simulation box. cutoff\+: real(8), intent(in)
\item The cutoff distance for the Lennard-\/\+Jones potential. F\+: real(8), dimension(\+N, 3), intent(out)
\item The forces acting on each particle. pot\+: real(8), intent(out)
\item The potential energy of the system.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Notes\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The positions of the particles are given as a 3D array, where each row represents the position of a particle in Cartesian coordinates.
\item The forces acting on each particle are calculated and stored in the {\ttfamily F} array.
\item The potential energy of the system is calculated and stored in the {\ttfamily pot} variable.
\item The subroutine uses periodic boundary conditions to handle particles that are close to the edges of the simulation box.
\item The subroutine assumes that the {\ttfamily pbc} subroutine is defined elsewhere in the code, which handles the periodic boundary conditions.
\item The subroutine assumes that the {\ttfamily isnan} function is available to check for NaN values.
