# Project-III

## Brief description of the project
This project involves the development of a simple molecular dynamics program to simulate a Van der Waals gas of particles. The project requires collaborative work from all team members to ensure the successful implementation of a working program code. Each team member has a specific task that contributes to the overall functionality of the program.

## Team Members and Responsibilities

1. **Aina Gaya**: Integration Newton's equations.
2. **Albert Plazas**: Compute the forces for a Van der Waals interaction.
3. **Manel Serrano**:  Post-processing of data, statistics, and visualization.
4. **Anna Moncl√∫s**:  Initialize the configuration and define boundary conditions. Also coordinates the GitHub repository.
